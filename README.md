# Get_Old_Tweets - Python
This is a repository which contains a script in Python to retrieve the tweets from Twitter API.

## Description: 

I was working on a project for which I needed the earlier tweets. But, I noticed that Twitter official API does not allow its normal developers to retrieve tweets of older than a week. There are some pre-built tools which provide access to earlier tweets but most of them are actually paid ones. I searched for some method to get the tweets and I luckily found them but, after trying a lot to troubleshoot the errors, I realised that even the most popular ones are now outdated just after the latest update release of Twitter last month. I observed that scholars, developers and researchers are facing lot of troubles due to this problem. So, I did some more research and finally ended up with a working solution. 

*Process: Clone this repository and run this jupyter notebook on your system. 
You will require your credentials. And the further process is simple. With this script, you can successfully retrieve older tweets also. Congratulations!*
