# Get_Old_Tweets - Python
This is a repository which contains a script in Python to retrieve the tweets from Twitter API.

## Story: 
I was working on a project for which I needed the earlier tweets. But, I noticed that twitter API does not allow its normal developers to retrieve tweets of older than 7 days. I searched for some method to get the tweets but, all of those I went through were actually outdated just after the latest update of Twitter last month. I observed that scholars and researchers are facing lot of troubles due to this problem. So, I did some more research and finally ended up with a working solution. 

*Process: Clone this repository and run this jupyter notebook on your system. 
You will require your credentials. And the process is simple. With this script, you can successfully retrieve older tweets also. Congratulations!*
